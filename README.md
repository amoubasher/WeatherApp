In this application, I made a weather app that will show the user the weather for which-ever city they enter into the search bar.
The output will show the user the current day, as well as the next 5 days of weather for that area.
It will show the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity for the next 5 days.
The page will also be dynamic meaning it will save their search history in LocalStorage and allow the user to click on their previous search to see the information again.
